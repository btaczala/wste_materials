Exceptions: 
* why do we need exceptions - on a simple "atoi" example
int       atoi( const char *str ); - atoi return 0 when no conversion is able to do

EXCERCISE - implement a atoi function on your own

* what's a try block and what to do with exception
* what to throw and what not to throw
* what is rethrowing
* how to correctly implement catch() 
* catch(...)
* exceptions specifiers + noexcept

* can I resume program while throw?  (struct File)
* Philosophical: when to throw and when not to throw

* Pitfalls: performance, slicing, catching by non-const ref, catching by value

Garbage in/garbage out philosophy
